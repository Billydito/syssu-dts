=========

SysSU-DTS (System Support for Ubiquity - Distribute Tuple Space), is a system support that provides functionality for coordinating ubiquitous systems in open environments, where no assumptions about available resources should be made. It focus on ubiquitous systems based on mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks, which can communicate through a Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET).  SysSU-DTS extends an existing  system support called SysSU, it is based on Tuple Spaces and Publish/Subscribe coordenation model. SysSU-DTS improves SysSU in order to offer a better management of high distributed information.
